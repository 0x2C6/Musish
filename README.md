### Apple Music... ish
Frustrated by the lack of access to the greatest bangers in our ever-growing music libraries (when away from our laptops and bound to the confines of work computers) we decided to create the single greatest web-based music client for Apple Music. Apple doesn't provide one officially which greatly helped to be honest with you...

## What it does
Plays music. Without hassle. In a web browser. With your Apple ID. Revolutionary.
Musish allows a user to authenticate using their Apple ID (while subscribed to Apple Music), and browse their Music library on the go. We plan to add music discovery, clean the UI up even more, and throw some glitter all over it before long! âœ¨

### To run locally
```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
